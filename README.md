# Conway's Game of Life

## Overview

This project is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life in C#. Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. The game consists of a grid of cells that can live, die, or multiply based on a few mathematical rules.

## Prerequisites

- .NET SDK (version 5.0 or later)
